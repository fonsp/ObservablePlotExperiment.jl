# ObservablePlotExperiment.jl
Fast exploratory plotting – Julia wrapper for the [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) library.

The Observable library is amazing and the combination with Julia through HypertextLiteral.jl works crazy well!


# How to use

The aim of the library is to have API that is super close to the original [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) library. **Check out [their documentation](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/marks).**
