# ObservablePlotExperiment.jl
Fast exploratory plotting – Julia wrapper for the [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) library.

The Observable library is amazing and the combination with Julia through HypertextLiteral.jl works crazy well!


# Experimental!!
This library is just a fun experiment!! And with some patience it might create really beautiful plots!

## Warning ⚠️
I am just trying to have fun, so this library will not be super well maintained! There will probably not be any docs, tests or any guarantees of that kind1 💛
